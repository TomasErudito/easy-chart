## Project development plan<br/>
<br/>
<p>The development of this project has been divided following the UX five layers model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strategy: The website wants to allow the user to create, customize and export the chart in a fast and easy way.</li>
<li>Scope: The website need to answer 3 questions:</li>
<ul>
<li>•	What do the website does?</li>
<li>•	Is it easy to create/customize/export the chart?</li>
<li>•	Would the user enjoy the experience?</li>
</ul>
<li>Structure: The website is divided in 2 sections:</li>
<ul>
<li>•	Home – Presentation of the aplication and usage guide.</li>
<li>•	Chart creation – Creation of the chart through the creation tools.</li>
</ul>
<li>Skeleton: The information’s organization is simple so the users can navigate easily through the content, create their chart easily, and they should be able of complete the process fast:</li>
<ul>
<li>•	Header with navigation menu.</li>
<li>•	Steps explanation in the Home page.</li>
<li>•	Easy to use creation's menu.</li>
<li>•	Clear text / icons.</li>
<li>•	Extra information (help / information).</li>
</ul>
<li>Surface: Visual design of the website.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p>The mockups of the site present a very clean and simple structure with the instructions on the first page:</p>
<br/>

<h3>UX solutions</h3>
<br/>

<h3>First Time Visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should be able to answer the 3 questions we proposed, before (What do the website does? / 
Is it easy to create/customize/export the chart? / Would the user enjoy the experience?) easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the company is resume what the application does: charts in an easy way.</li>
<li>The process is simple and straight forward.</li>
<li>The page is not cluttered and it's kept as simple as possible to make the process easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be able to create the chart and export it easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The flow of the process is linear and anything not strictly necessary has been eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be comfortable creating different charts and experimenting with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even the process has been simplified, there are enough options to allow the user to experiment the different types of charts that could be created.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should want to share the website with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simplicity of the process and speed of the results could create promoters of the site among colleages.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Returning visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should be able to create the chart and export it easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 14 clicks the user can create a customised chart from one excel file from their computer.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>•	Should choose the aplication as their first choice to create charts for the web.</p>
<ul>
<li>When other websites offer lots of different options that requiere time to learn and configurate, with many different options that distract the user from the final result, Easy chart keeps simple the process.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Design<br/>
<br/>

<p>The potential customers would be people of any age who need to create a chart. These group of people could be professionals or students and the main reaso to create the chart should be a job or studies necessity. For this reason the website / application is designed to run on a desktop / laptop / tablet with a medium to large screen, and it's not intended to be used on a phone.</p>

<p>The site pretends to be simple and fast, any unnecessary elements has been eliminated.</p>

<p>There are three separate areas clearly separated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigation menu with the new button to start the creation of the chart, the export button to download the chart and the help button.</li>
<li>The creation menu on the left hand side.</li>
<li>The main central area where the data and the chart will be displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The typography used is Asanine to give a friendly feeling.</p>


## Technologies used<br/>
<br/>

<p>The languages used are:</p>

<p>•	HTML 5</p>
<p>•	CSS</p>

<p>Also, during the creation of the different elements of the project, I used:</p>	

<p>•	Photoshop – Create and / or edit images like the logo.</p>
<p>•	Bootstrap 4.1.3 – To help with the responsive design.</p>
<p>•	JQuery – Used for the navigation bar on mobiles and the carousel on the index page.</p>
<p>•	Font Awesome – Used for the icons on all the pages.</p>
<p>•	Git – Used for the version control within Gitpod.</p>
<p>•	GitHub – Used to store the project.</p>
<p>•	GitPod – IDE used to develop the project. Used the Code Institute template to setup the IDE environment.</p>
<br/>

## Testing<br/>
<br/>
	
<p>The W3C validator has been used to ensure that every HTML and CSS files are free of syntax errors.</p>

<p>The website has been tested on different browsers:</p>

<p>•	Google Chrome</p>
<p>•	Microsoft Edge</p>
<p>•	Opera</p>
<p>•	Firefox</p>

<p>Also has been tested on different devices:</p>

<p>•	Laptop (Windows)</p>
<p>•	Desktop (Windows)</p>
<p>•	Android tablets</p>
<br/>
<p>More testing has been done about usability and user experience. To achieve this, I proposed to some friends to navigate through the website and answer the questions about the UX goals explained before:</p>

<h3>First Time Visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should be able to answer the 3 questions we proposed, before (What do the website does? / 
Is it easy to create/customize/export the chart? / Would the user enjoy the experience?) easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users can identify the use of the site, they can create one chart, once they create the first chart they want to try how the other types of charts look like.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be able to create the chart and export it easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The users can create the charts very easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be comfortable creating different charts and experimenting with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the users stayed in the site trying different charts and "playing" with the different options.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should want to share the website with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simplicity of the process, the different options and speed of the results make the users to recommend the site to others.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Returning visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should be able to create the chart and export it easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once they used the website once, they were able to create charts very fast and easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should be able to create the chart fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once they used the website once, they were able to create charts very fast and easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should feel comfortable using the aplication.</p>
<ul>
<li>They found the process of creation very "natural" and "logic".</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Frequent visitors</h3>

<p>•	Should be able to create the chart fast.</p>
<ul>
<li>After few visits the users could create the charts "without thinking about it".</li>
</ul>
<p>•	Should choose the aplication as their first choice to create charts for the web.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the users that test the application wanted it to use it for they jobs / studies.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

## Bugs<br/>
<br/>
<p>During the development process, and later on during the testing, some bugs / deficiencies have been detected. Some were functionals (links not working,...), some were about interaction (buttons are clearly interactive, accessibility...), some aesthetics (colors, sizes,...)</p>
<p>The most challenging part has been the automation of the creation of the different charts, as needed to use the right data with a thrid party resource that creates the charts.</p>
<p>Also I needed to limitate the number of columns that can be created as having problems with the redimension of the table to contain the data.</p>
<p>There is one circunstance that I didn't find the right solution: When the user creates one table but the data is empty, theres no chart created, but at the same time I should accept that some values could se empty.</p>
<br/>

## Credits<br/>
<br/>

<p>There is some Javascript that it wasn't created by me:</p>	

<p>•	The file importxls.js (upload the xls file and returns one object) is based on the code from Midhun T P (developer) shared in the page https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/reading-a-excel-file-using-html5-jquery/. And modified by me (the parts that I wrote are marked)</p>
<p>•	The file JS_carousel.js (controls the carousel used for the instructions in the first page) is based on the Bootstrap JS Carousel.</p>
<p>•	To create the charts, I used the open source Chart.js (linked on the header) MIT license</p>
<p>•	To download the charts, I use html2canvas (marked in the file myJavascript.js) MIT license</p>
<br/>


<h3>External help</h3><br/>

<p>To find solutions to some difficulties during the creation of the project, I used:</p>	

<p>•	Bootstrap documentation</p>
<p>•	W3Schools</p>
<p>•	Stackoverflow</p>
<br/>
